# Overview
This program is designed to be a text based rpg. Please enjoy fighting the alien scourge

The code in this program is organized into 5 classes. 
1. The world class at the highest level to store all information that needs to be globaly available. 
2. The Player class to store information about the player and provide the player's mutable stats.
3. The game class that handles the player's ability to interact with the world.
4. The Explore class that provides the logic needed to gain new items, find new locations, and "explore".
5. The Program class that ties them all together and calls the different funcitons when needed. 

I wrote this software to provide a fun experience to those who use it while demostrating and growing my ability to use C#

# Future Work

- The game is currently rather bland as there aren't a ton of different paths the player can go on. 
- a visual representation and a better looking console would make this game much better.
